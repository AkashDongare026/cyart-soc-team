The simulated breach revealed gaps in alert triage speed, phishing detection rules, and user awareness. Strengthening SOC playbooks, improving MITRE-based alert classification, enhancing email filtering, and enforcing regular training significantly improve response efficiency. Faster escalation procedures and better documentation ensure reduced incident impact and improved overall security readiness.
